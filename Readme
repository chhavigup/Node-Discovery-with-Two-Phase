This package supports to types of Configs. 
1. Nodes.cfg file type storage for IP:Port of the nodes
2. KeyValue pair central storage for IP:Port of the nodes

==================================================================

To execute KeyValue central type, in this example we start two nodes (node1 and node2)
1. First run the Membership server  - sample command
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar ms_start  -> This command is to start the membershipo server and the port is 1234

2. Start node1
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar ts 1252 XXX.X.X.X 1234  -> This is to start the another node on port 1252

3. Start node2
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar ts 1251 XXX.X.X.X 1234  -> This is to start the another node on port 1252

No you can test it out with the client code - to put a,10, here the node's port we want to talk with is 1251
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar tc XXX.X.X.X 1251 put a 10 - this will sync the put with other nodes
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar tc XXX.X.X.X 1251 del a  - this will sync the del with other nodes
java -jar target/GenericNode.jar tc XXX.X.X.X 1251 store - to see the storge in this node.
